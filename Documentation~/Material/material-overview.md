# Material Generator

Material Generator uses machine learning to create realistic materials for 3D objects based on text-based prompts and reference images. You can simulate lifelike surfaces, such as wood, metal, brick, and others.

You can apply the generated materials directly to objects in your **Scene** view and adjust them using different material maps and settings.

Material Generator supports [physically based rendering (PBR)](xref:material-generate-prompt), which allows the materials to respond accurately to lighting and environmental conditions in Unity.

Use the following topics to get started with using Material Generator.

| Topic | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| [Generate material using a prompt](xref:material-generate-prompt) | Generate materials using text-based prompt. |
| [Use the PBR tab](xref:material-pbr) | Simulate how light interacts with the material's surface. |
| [Use the Upscale tab](xref:material-upscale) | Refine the generated material to achieve better clarity. |
| [Manage generated material](xref:material-manage) | Manage and organize your generated material. |
