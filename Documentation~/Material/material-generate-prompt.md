# Generate material with a prompt

Use the Material Generator to generate a new material using a text-based prompt and refine it using reference images and material properties.

To generate a new material, follow these steps:

1. Right-click an empty area in the **Project** window.
1. Select **Create** > **Rendering** > **Generate Material**.

   The **New Material** window opens. 
1. Select **Change** to open the **Select Model** window and choose a model.
1. Enter a text description of the material you want to create in the **Prompt** field.

   For example, `Wooden floor with natural grain`.

1. Enter elements you want to exclude from the generated material in the **Negative Prompt** field.

   For example, `No scratches or dirt`.

1. Use the **Materials** slider to set the number of variations of the material to generate.
1. Enable **Custom Seed** to generate consistent results.
1. Enter a seed number or let the tool generate one automatically.
1. (Optional) In the **Pattern Reference** field, do the following:
   1. Select the browse icon to open the **Select Texture 2D** window.
   2. Select a reference image to guide the pattern or control net.

      > [!NOTE]
      > For best results, use the provided `pattern_##` textures, which are optimized for seamless tiling and enhance material quality.
1. Select **Generate** to create the material.

The generated material appears in the **Generations** panel. Hover over a material to view details like the model used and prompt settings.

## Work with generated material

The generated material appears in the **Inspector** window. The preview sphere and cube provide a live update as you modify textures, patterns, and settings.

* The sphere helps visualize how the material behaves on curved surfaces.
* The cube helps to evaluate for tiling and seamlessness, especially for patterns and structured materials.

The generated material includes a base map, which acts as a simple foundation. Use the [**PBR**](xref:material-pbr) tab to achieve advanced material properties for an extra layer of realism.

You can apply the material to your objects in the **Scene** view.
