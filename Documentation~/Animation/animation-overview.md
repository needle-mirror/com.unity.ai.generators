# Animation Generator

Animation Generator uses machine learning to create animation clips directly from text or video inputs. It also lets you integrate animations into your projects. By using `.anim` files, character prefabs, and Animator Controllers, you can design visually dynamic games with smooth character movements. 

There are two generation methods:

* **Text to Motion**: Generates an animation based on a text prompt.
* **Video to Motion**: Generates an animation based on an uploaded video.

After generating the animation clip, you can assign it to a character using an Animator Controller.

Animation Generator supports three key workflows:

* Create `.anim` files
* Add character prefabs to your scene
* Assign the animation files to your character
