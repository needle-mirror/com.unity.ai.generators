# Texture2D Generator

Texture2D Generator uses machine learning to create high-quality 2D assets based on text-based prompts and reference images. You can apply the generated images directly to objects in the **Scene** view, adjust the resolution, and modify the visual style to suit your game design.

Texture2D Generator lets you do the following: 

* Generate images using text-based prompts.
* Apply reference images to control image style and pattern.
* Fine-tune resolution and visual properties.
* Create stylised 2D assets, such as characters, backdrops, items and game icons.
