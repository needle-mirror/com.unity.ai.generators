# Modify generated cubemap

Refine and upscale the generated cubemaps to create production-ready, high-resolution assets.

Use the **Upscale** tab to convert the initial generation (a preview) into a final, high-quality cubemap suitable for use in skyboxes, reflection probes, or other large-scale environments. Upscaling enhances resolution and clarity without losing detail.

## Upscale

To upscale a cubemap, follow these steps:

1. In the **Generate** window, select the **Upscale** tab.
2. Review the cubemap in the **Base Image** section.
3. Select **Upscale**.
