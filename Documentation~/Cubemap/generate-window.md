# Generate window reference

Access and configure AI generation options to create new cubemaps.

Use the **Generate** window to define prompts, models, and reference controls for generating cubemaps. The generated cubemaps are saved as `.jpg` files when first generated, and `.png` files when upscaled.

The following table describes the options available on the **Generate** window:

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Prompt** | Enter a text description of the cubemap you want to create. |
| **Negative prompt** | Enter elements you want to exclude from the asset. |
| **Model selection** | Select **Change** to choose the AI model used for asset generation. |
| **Add More Controls To Prompt**| Define how reference images influence the generated cubemap. |
| **Count** | Set the number of cubemaps to generate. |
| **Custom seed** | Set a fixed seed for consistent asset generation. |
| **Generate** | Generate the cubemap. |
