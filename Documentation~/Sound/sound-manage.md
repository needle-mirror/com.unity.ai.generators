# Manage generated sounds

Sound Generator lets you manage and organize the generated audio clips. After the sounds are generated, they're accessible from your `Assets` folder. The default file extension is `.wav`.

To export or reuse your sound, right-click the file in the `Assets` folder and select **Show in Explorer** (Windows) or **Reveal in Finder** (MacOS) to locate the file on your computer.

The right-click context menu within the Sound Generator provides options for reusing or copying the generated sounds.

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Select** | Highlights the audio clip in the **Project** window. |
| **Promote to asset** | Replaces the current audio clip with the selected one. |
| **Reveal in Finder** | Opens the file location on your computer. |
| **Show Generation Data** | Displays the model and prompt details used to create the audio clip. |

The **Generation Data** window lets you view and reuse settings used to create a generated audio clip.
