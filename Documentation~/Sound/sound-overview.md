# Sound Generator

Sound Generator uses machine learning to create custom audio clips from text-to-sound models or reference audio clips. You can also record your own sounds, and use AI to modify them or generate new variations. Use the Unity Editor to manage the generated audio assets directly within your project. 

Sound Generator simplifies audio creation as follows:

* Uses AI to generate sounds based on text prompts or existing audio references.
* Removes the need for complex audio editing or synthesis skills.
* Records custom sounds directly within the Unity Editor with a microphone.
* Stores the generated and recorded audio clips in the `Assets` folder.
* Supports `.wav` format for compatibility and editing.

Sound Generator supports three key workflows:

* [Text-to-sound generation](xref:sound-prompt): Create audio clips from text prompts.
* [Sound reference-based generation](xref:sound-reference): Generate sound effects similar to a provided audio file.
* [Record custom sound](xref:sound-record): Record and modify custom sounds, with the ability to overwrite reference sounds.
