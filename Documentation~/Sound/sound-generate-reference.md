# Generate sound assets with a sound reference

You can generate sounds based on an existing audio clip as a reference.

To generate audio from a sound reference, follow these steps: 

1. Open the **Generate New Audio Clip** window.
1. In the **Sound Reference** section, select the browse icon. 
1. In the **Select Audio Clip** window, select an existing audio clip from your `Assets` folder. 
1. Use the **Strength** slider to control how closely the generated sound matches the reference.
1. (Optional) Enable **Overwrite Sound Reference asset** if you want to use a newly recorded sound as the reference.
1. Select **Generate**.

Sound Generator saves the generated sound file in `.wav` format in the `Assets` folder.
