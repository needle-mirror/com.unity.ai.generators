# Types of Generators

Generators consists of the following tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------| ------------|
| **Sprite Generator** | Generates high-quality 2D sprites based on text-based prompts and reference images.
| **Texture Generator** | Generates high-quality 2D assets based on text-based prompts and reference images. |
| **Material Generator** | Produces realistic surface materials using physically based rendering (PBR) properties. |
| **Sound Generator** | Generates game-ready audio assets. |
| **Animation Generator** | Creates animations based on character models and motion data. |

## Features of Generators

Generators provide a range of benefits to streamline asset creation and development.

* Faster asset creation: Generate game-ready assets using text-based prompts. You don't need to create assets manually from scratch.
* Creative flexibility: Use reference images to experiment with different styles and variations without any complex adjustments. 
* Improved quality: Generate assets with consistent resolution, color schemes, and patterns. Upscale low-resolution assets without losing quality.
* Reduced workload: Automate repetitive tasks like sprite creation and image generation rather than starting from scratch.
* Dynamic adaptation: Modify generated assets in real-time to suit different game environments.
