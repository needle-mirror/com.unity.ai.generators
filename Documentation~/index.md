# About Unity AI Generators

Unity AI Generators is a Unity package that provides a set of tools to create AI-generated assets from text input. AI Generators use machine learning to create, modify, and optimize game assets, such as texture, material, sound, and animation. These generators automate repetitive tasks and enhance creative workflows by generating high-quality assets based on user-defined prompts and settings.

Use the following topics to get started with using AI Generator tools.

| Topic | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| [AI Generator tools](ai-gen-tools.md) | Get to know the Unity's AI Generator tools and their features. |
| [Texture2D Generator](xref:texture2d-overview) | Learn how to use machine learning to create high-quality 2D assets based on text-based prompts and reference images. |
| [Sound Generator](xref:sound-intro) | Learn how to create custom audio clips from text-to-sound models or reference audio clips. |
