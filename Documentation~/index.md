# About Generators

Generators is a set of tools to create AI-generated assets from text input. Generators use machine learning to create, modify, and optimize game assets, such as texture, material, sound, and animation. These generators automate repetitive tasks and enhance creative workflows by generating high-quality assets based on user-defined prompts and settings.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the **AI** menu and tools in the Unity Editor, ensure that:

* Your project is using Unity 6.2 (6000.2).
* You [agreed and accepted](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ai-menu.html) the terms and conditions on the **AI** menu in the Unity Editor.

For more information, refer to [AI menu in Unity Editor](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ai-menu.html).

Use the following topics to get started with using Generators.
