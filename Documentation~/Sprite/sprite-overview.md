# Sprite Generator

Sprite Generator uses machine learning to create high-quality 2D sprites based on text-based prompts and reference images. A sprite is a 2D image that you can use as a 2D element in a game, such as a dog or a tree. You can apply the generated sprites directly to the **Scene** view, adjust the resolution, and modify the visual style to suit your game design.

Sprite Generator lets you do the following: 

* Generate sprites with text-based prompts.
* Apply reference images to control sprite style and shape.
* Fine-tune resolution and visual properties.
* Create stylised 2D assets, such as characters or icons.
